## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run this project you need **Python 3+** installed along with **Jupyter Notebook** to work on the same.
Other python packages used for the analysis are:
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
With this analysis, I wanted to confirm some thoughts I had after I watched the movie [Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)).
1. In the movie it was shown that women and children were first sent on life boats when the Titanic sunk. I want to confirm whether the data gave the same outcome and that there was a better chance of survival if you were a female or a child.
2. Similar to the above one, whether there was a better chance of survival if you were from the first class?
3. What factors contributed most to the survival of passengers on the Titanic?
4. Given a new passenger on the Titanic, with what certainty can my model predict whether the passenger can survive or not?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
* **train.csv** - training dataset for this project
* **test.csv** - test dataset for this project
* **titanic-dataset-exploration.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook that consists my analysis for the questions above. I have made sure that the notebook is readable and gives you an insight into my thought process during each step. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://www.priyankapalshetkar.com/post/exploring-graphql-as-an-alternative-to-rest-api-part-1).

## Licensing and Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
The information for this project can be found here - [Titanic - Machine Learning for Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Licensing for the data and more information about the dataset in general can be found on the same link. I have also added the dataset to this repo just in case.
